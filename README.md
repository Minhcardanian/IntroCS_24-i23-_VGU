# IntroCS Group Repository Structure

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following two main directories:

### 1. `Assignment/`
This directory contains all the assignments for the course. Each assignment will be stored in a subdirectory, and additional resources or reference materials specific to the assignments will also be provided here.


### 2. `Material/`
This directory houses all the course materials, including lecture slides, reading lists, and other learning resources provided throughout the course.
